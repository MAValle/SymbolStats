## Estimate the log variations

We can use the package to estimate the log variations between periods. If values are for example, stock prices, then this function computes the returns.
Also we can compute variations taking values between $P$ periods and taking overlaps.


```{r variation-example}
str(alldata)
returns_result <- logvariations_computation(prices = alldata$`^GSPC`, P=3, overlap=3)
str(returns_result)
```

The result is a vector with all returns of three days of the SP500 (in `alldata` dataframe) with NO overlapping.
